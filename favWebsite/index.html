    <h3>Here are the reasons I enjoy itâ†“</h3>


    <h5>#1</h5>
    <h4>The characters</h4>

    <img src = "rsCharacters.png" style=width:600;">

    <h5>The characters are easily the best part of the show
        as I will admit the story board and what happens in each episode is
        extremely repetitive.
    </h5>

    <h5>#2</h5>
    <h4>It's iconic</h4>

    <img src = "icon.jfif" style=width:400;>
    <h5>This show will forever keep a special place in my memory.</h5>
    
    
        <h5>#3</h5>
        <h4>The origin and humble ideaology</h4>
    
        <img src = "JoelQuintel.png" style=width:600;">
    
        <h5>The creator J.G Quintel said himself, exactly what he was thinking when
            he created the show. He said he based it off how he and his boys were when they around eachother
            and that just almost makes it even better. It makes me think of my friends and how we screw around
            with eachother.
